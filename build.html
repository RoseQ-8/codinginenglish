        <h1>Building Your Site</h1>
        <p>Your aim is to get the AI to write all the code you need. This will take lots of prompts for the model, but this guide should help you with the process.</p>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Step 1: Brainstorm with AI</h2>
            <p>Begin by using AI to help conceptualize your site. Tools like ChatGPT can provide creative website themes, layout ideas, and content suggestions based on current trends. If you don't know what you wan the site to look like, the AI can provide some suggestions. If you have a clear idea, use the AI to refine it and specify exactly what you want.</p>

            <h2>Step 2: Generate Your Code, And Your Content</h2>
            <p> Ask the AI to write the code you need for your website, and paste it into your code editor. Be sure to specify in detail what you want the site to look like. If you ask it to, the LLM will walk you through the whole process of pasting the code and inserting any files or URLs that you want linked to the site.</p>

            <h2>Step 3: Start Making Changes</h2>
            <p> After checking out what your site looks like in your browser, make adjustments as needed by asking the AI to rewrite your code with the desired changes. During this stage, I found it useful to make very vague comments. For example, asking the AI to "make this page more exciting" is often an effective prompt.</p>

            <h2>Step 4: Personalize Your Website</h2>
            <p> It's easy enough to change the actual text in your website. Just look through the code on your text editor for the text that you want to change, and type what you want to see. Replace generic images with your own files, and make simple changes to your content.</p>

            <h2>Step 5: Mastering the Design Process</h2>
            <p>If you come across errors or something that interests you, your AI can serve as a patient teacher. Becoming acquainted with the general look of the HTML code is helpful if you want to make specific edits without changing the page completely. You can also ask the AI for ideas on features that might enhance your website. </p>
