            <h2>Choosing the Right Text Editor</h2>
            <p>The first step in web development is choosing a text editor that suits your needs. Text editors are services that allow you to create and edit pages of code, which your web browser will translate into a website. Here are some options based on your operating system:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Windows:</strong> Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text</li>
                <li><strong>macOS:</strong> TextEdit for basics, BBEdit, Visual Studio Code</li>
                <li><strong>Linux:</strong> Gedit, Kate, Visual Studio Code</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This site was created using <strong>TextEdit</strong> on macOS, which is very user-friendly and good for beginners.</p>

        <section id="local-development">
            <h2>Starting Locally</h2>
            <p>Before thinking about hosting your site online, start by building locally. That means you run the site on your personal computer before making it accessible to the public. This allows you to experiment and test your website in a safe environment on your own computer without the need for an internet connection.</p>
            <p>Once you've developed your site locally, look into different ways to make your site public on the Going Online page of this site.</p>

            <h2>Using AI as Your Assistant</h2>
            <p>If you have questions or need coding assistance, don't hesitate to ask AI. Tools like Chat-GPT can offer guidance, write code snippets, and even help debug your scripts.</p>
            <p>AI isn't just for codingâ€”use it to brainstorm ideas, manage project tasks, generate art, and optimize your workflow.</p>
