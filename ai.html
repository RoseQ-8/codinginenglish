        <h1>Working with AI in Web Development</h1>
        <p>Getting familiar with AI tools is the first step to producing great AI-assisted work. Many beginners underestimate the capabilities of generative AI, when in reality, they are giving poor prompts to the LLM. It is essential to master prompt writing before you build your website. The better you know the AI, the better your website will be. </p>

            <h2>Writing Effective AI Prompts</h2>
            <p>Here's how you can craft prompts that generate useful and creative outputs:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Define Your Goal:</strong> Clearly state in detail what you want the AI to generate. Be specific about the task or the problem you are trying to solve. If possible, give a set of criteria for the AI to meet in its responses.</li>
                <li><strong>Provide Context:</strong> Give the AI enough background information to understand the subject better. Give the model a role to play (researcher, math teacher, web designer, etc) and explain exactly how you expect it to answer prompts. </li>
                <li><strong>Use Clear and Concise Language:</strong> While creativity is important, clarity in your prompts will help the AI provide the most accurate and relevant information. Try usin</li>
                <li><strong>Iterate and Refine:</strong> AI might not get it right the first time. Refine your prompts based on the outputs you receive, and iterate as needed. Even asking the AI to "try again" or "try harder" can produce a better quality response. </li>
            </ol>
