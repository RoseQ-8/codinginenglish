            <h2>My Project</h2>
            <p>My mission is to make web development accessible to everyone. Andrej Karpathy recently tweeted that <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1617979122625712128?lang=en">"the hottest new programming language is English."</a> This project applies that theory to the realm of web design. Here, you'll learn how to leverage generative AI to build websites without any prior training in web design. Discover how to bring your ideas to life with no coding background required.</p>

            <h2>The Future of Coding</h2>
            <p>AI is revolutionizing how we build the web. This site, which I built entirely using generative AI, demonstrates the potential of AI-assisted web design for unskilled programmers. The quality and efficiency of this process rivals that of website-building tools such as Wordpress and Google Sites, and I believe that the future of web design lies in AI-based coding tools. </p>
